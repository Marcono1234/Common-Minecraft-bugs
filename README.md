# Common Minecraft bugs
Lists of bug types which are common in Minecraft. The types are based on bugs which have been reported and acknowledged as bug or have already been fixed in the past.

These lists are mainly intended for players as hint where to look for bugs when a new version is released, but the lists can also be helpful hints for the developers in case they don't have such compilations already.
